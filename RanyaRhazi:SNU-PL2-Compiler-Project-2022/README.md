# Term Project: Building a Compiler for SnuPL/2

In this term project, we are going to implement a simple compiler for the SnuPL/2 language. 
Our compiler will compile SnuPL/2 source code to 64-bit assembly code.

SnuPL/2 is an imperative procedural language closely related to the [Oberon programming language](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/Oberon/index.html), one of the many languages developed by Prof. Niklaus Wirth. 
SnuPL/2 does not support object-orientation and the only composite data type supported are arrays. 
Records or enumerations are not supported. 
Nevertheless, SnuPL/2 is complex enough to illustrate the basic concepts of a compiler.

The project will be conducted in several phases as follows

| Phase | Topic             | Handout             | Deadline |
